Solr Javascript UI
------------------

This project aims to provide a nice google-like search interface with which the user can test 
its solr configuration and searches.

This application is showcased here: http://juancavallotti.github.com/solrui/

At the moment the configuration provided is the default one, but the use may change it by editing
the js/searchengine.js file.

Please feel free to request enhancements in our issue tracker.
